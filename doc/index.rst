Welcome to the Erbsland Unittest Documentation!
===============================================

Welcome to *Erbsland UnitTest*, a standalone unit testing system designed for testing libraries and applications. Our unit testing system is built with a focus on productivity and minimal dependencies. For more convenient usage, it requires only a minimal set of dependencies (C++, CMake, Python) and is compatible with any compiler that support C++17 or any newer version of the language.
