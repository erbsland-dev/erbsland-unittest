Preface
=======

Welcome to *Erbsland UnitTest*, a standalone unit testing system designed for testing libraries and applications. Our unit testing system is built with a focus on productivity and minimal dependencies. For more convenient usage, it requires only a minimal set of dependencies (C++, CMake, Python) and is compatible with any compiler that support C++17 or any newer version of the language.

Requirements
------------

Code Level Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A C++ compiler compatible with C++17 or later versions.
- A C++ standard library that supports C++17 features.

Build and Metadata System Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the recommended setup with CMake and minimal configuration, you'll need:

- CMake version 3.25 or newer.
- Python 3.11 or newer to compile the metadata.

Example Project
---------------

There is an example project that demonstrates all basic features and the recommended structure how to use this unit testing system.
