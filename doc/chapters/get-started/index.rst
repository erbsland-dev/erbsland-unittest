Getting Started
===============

**Welcome! Let’s Begin Writing Your First Unit Test**

This guide will walk you through creating a small unit test for our example library using the Erbsland UnitTest framework. To get started, ensure you have:

* Your favorite C++ development environment.
* A Git client of your choice.

We’ll demonstrate using command-line tools, but you’re encouraged to use whatever tools you prefer to achieve the same results.
