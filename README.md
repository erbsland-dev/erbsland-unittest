# Erbsland Unit Testing System

Welcome to *Erbsland UnitTest*, a standalone unit testing system originally designed for testing Erbsland libraries and applications. Built with a focus on minimal dependencies—making it practically dependency-free—it serves as a lightweight and flexible testing framework. The system is compatible with any C++17 or newer compiler.

While no special build tools are required to use this framework, for a more convenient experience, CMake and Python are recommended.

## Where to start?

Please read the [Getting Started](https://erbsland-dev.github.io/erbsland-unittest/chapters/get-started/) chapter where you get a step-by-step guide how to set up your first unit test.

▶️ [Getting Started](https://erbsland-dev.github.io/erbsland-unittest/chapters/get-started/)

Or just have a look at the [example project](https://github.com/erbsland-dev/erbsland-unittest-example) that demonstrates the recommended project structure and most of the basic features.
