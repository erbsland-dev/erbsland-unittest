# The Erbsland Unit Testing System

Welcome to *Erbsland UnitTest*, a standalone unit testing system designed for testing Erbsland libraries and applications. Our unit testing system is built with a focus on minimal dependencies, making it theoretically dependency-free. For a more convenient usage, it requires only a minimal set of dependencies (C++, CMake, Python) and is compatible with any C++17 or later compiler.

## Where to start?

Please read the [quick start](https://github.com/erbsland-dev/erbsland-unittest/wiki/Quick%20Start) guide where you get a step-by-step guide how to set up your first unit test.
