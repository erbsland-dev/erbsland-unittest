# Erbsland Unit Testing System

Welcome to **Erbsland UnitTest** ‚Äî a lightweight and modern unit testing framework designed specifically for C++20 and beyond. Originally created for testing Erbsland libraries and applications, this system is tailored to be **practically dependency-free**, offering developers a clean and minimalistic testing environment.

Compatible with any C++20-compliant compiler, this framework is perfect for those who value simplicity and control in their testing workflows.

Although no external build tools are strictly required, we recommend using **CMake** and **Python** for a more streamlined experience, especially when working with metadata.

## Getting Started üöÄ

If you're new here, the best place to begin is the step-by-step **Getting Started Guide**. It walks you through everything you need to write and run your first unit test:
