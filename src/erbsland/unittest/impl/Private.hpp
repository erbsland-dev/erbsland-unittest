/// A minimalistic unittest system to allow *dependency free* tests of the library itself.
///
/// The system has no dependencies to the actual library, and the two files `UnitTest.hpp` and `UnitTest.cpp`,
/// with all implementation files in the folder `unittest/` can be used independently of the library.
///
/// There is a CMake extension that uses a Python script to automatically extract meta information from the
/// test declarations and write repetitive support code to run the tests. There is also an alternative
/// manual way to write all required registrations, without python scripts and CMake needed. The manual way
/// is not recommended, as it makes maintaining a lange number of unittest difficult if the system changes.
///
/// For a proper function of the unittest system, quite a number of preprocessor macros are required as the
/// C++ language provides no reflection for source code files and lines numbers.
///
/// In order to keep the unittests simple and small, there are no prefixes for these macros (e.g. `REQUIRE`).
/// Previously existing macros with the same names are overwritten.
///
/// For this reason:
/// - Use this file only for a dedicated unittest executable as demonstrated with the tests for this library.
///   See repository `ErbslandCoreUnitTest` for the tests.
/// - Add the `#include <erbsland/UnitTest.hpp>` as the last include statement in the file!
